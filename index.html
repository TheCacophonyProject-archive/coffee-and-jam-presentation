						<p>My task today is to define a word with looms large at this conference, making up fully half of the words in its title. Everybody has a sense of the world "Open" means, and that sense differs depending on who you talk to and depending on the context.</p>
						<p>Like many words, notably "natural", "organic" the word "open" has been lept upon by marketers who have identified that its meaning is so vague that it can be used to convey positive connotations about products which have not earned those connotations. They have succeeded in diluting the word "open" still further, to the extent that some of us have become a bit cynical and could rightly be described to be suffering from what market analysts refer to as "open fatigue" (I'm joking).</p>
						<p>So my goal here is to strip back the meaning of the word "open" in the contexts of  open source software and open society to its essence. And what is that, you might ask.</p>

						<p>Fundamentally, open in this context has to do with the human instinct to share.
							It's innate in most of us from a young age, but for many of us, like being inquisitive and having fun, the urge to share is something that we are taught to repress. In the professional - dare I say "enterprise" - world, talking about sharing was, for a long time, seen as quaint, hippy, naive, and even self-destructive. When I got into open source software, people in the "respectable" business world used to sneer and even openly laugh at those of us who promoted it. How times change.</p>
						<p>Part of the purpose of this conference is to help those of us who have become suspicious of those who share - and who recommend that others share for our mutual enrichment - recognise that we aren't joking. I suspect most of you're here today because you've been hearing a growing "buzz" around this concept of openness, typically associated with the rise of digital society and the Internet, and you want to understand its implications. I hope this conference shows you how much power you'll find in the principles of openness.</p>
