						<p>My task today is to define a word with looms large at this conference, making up fully half of the words in its title. Everybody has a sense of the world "Open" means, and that sense differs depending on who you talk to and depending on the context.</p>
						<p>Like many words, notably "natural", "organic" the word "open" has been lept upon by marketers who have identified that its meaning is so vague that it can be used to convey positive connotations about products which have not earned those connotations. They have succeeded in diluting the word "open" still further, to the extent that some of us have become a bit cynical and could rightly be described to be suffering from what market analysts refer to as "open fatigue" (I'm joking).</p>
						<p>So my goal here is to strip back the meaning of the word "open" in the contexts of  open source software and open society to its essence. And what is that, you might ask.</p>

						<p>Fundamentally, open in this context has to do with the human instinct to share.
						It's innate in most of us from a young age, but for many of us, like being inquisitive and having fun, the urge to share is something that we are taught to repress. In the professional - dare I say "enterprise" - world, talking about sharing was, for a long time, seen as quaint, hippy, naive, and even self-destructive. When I got into open source software, people in the "respectable" business world used to sneer and even openly laugh at those of us who promoted it. How times change.</p>
						<p>Part of the purpose of this conference is to help those of us who have become suspicious of those who share - and who recommend that others share for our mutual enrichment - recognise that we aren't joking. I suspect most of you're here today because you've been hearing a growing "buzz" around this concept of openness, typically associated with the rise of digital society and the Internet, and you want to understand its implications. I hope this conference shows you how much power you'll find in the principles of openness.</p>

					<h1>Not just see. Do.</h1>
					<p class="fragment">Scratch your own itch!</p>
					<p class="fragment">The ability to <em>participate</em> and <em>share ownership</em> is key to building sharing communities.</p>

					<aside class="notes">
						<p>The key to fostering community around Open is to recognise that it requires relinquishing control. It's a bit like the old saw "if you love something set it free"... The characteristic of open is participation, and the ability to attract diverse communities based on a sense of shared ownership. People buy into or commit to communities things where they feel they have something to offer, and where they have a sense of playing a useful part and sharing responsibility.</p>
						<p>The greatest strength of openness is the ability to share value and utility, but at the same time, the responsibilty of ongoing care and maintenance. For some people this is an imposition, and they choose not to participate. For others, on the other hand, it can be seen as fun, or a source of satisfaction and fulfillment. Luckily, particularly in the digital world, it only take small number of people willing to contribute to create something of great value to a far larger group. This, in turn, exposes the open thing to more people, attracting further volunteers, and a virtuous cycle forms. This is also known as critical mass and marks a healthy, sustainable community.</p>

					<h1>Onwards towards open</h1>
					<p>Use the principles of Open to gauge how you're doing now...<br />
					... and become progressively more open.</p>
					<p>Open may threaten the few who profit from "closed", but empowers many.</p>

					<aside class="notes">
						<p>Open isn't a state of being. It's a continual cycle of action and reflection. We live in a world where closed has become the expected norm. For most of us, the emergence of open seems "right" or "natural". I like to say that it "just tastes better", to co-opt a burger chain marketing catchphrase.</p>
						<p>We have to realise that open is a threat to some, particularly those who have power in closed source or closed society:</p>
						<ul>
   						<li>It reveals the levers of power to all who look: it becomes impossible to bluff, and </li>
							<li>It levels the playing field by revealing expoitation and inequality.</li>
							<li>It allows for true accountability and therefore justice.</li>
						</ul>

					<p>Remember: expedience is the enemy of principle.</p>
					<p>Think critically, be vigilant, expose frauds.</p>

					<aside class="notes">
						<p>Those people who have a big stake in closed will fight open. Especially in the proprietary software world, they see the momentum Open is gaining and stretch the meaning of the word open to include their closed products. This is known as "<a href="http://readwrite.com/2011/02/03/how_to_spot_openwashing">Openwashing</a>" - some They use the relative In the past they've had a fair bit of success, using their amassed wealth to influence governments to legislate against openness. But now the pendulum is swinging back, because open has shown its mettle. I think that the open revolution - and I do think it's a revolution of a sort - is an inherently emergent grass-roots response to the inequities we all either consciously or unconsciously perceive in our world. We need to hold these companies to account when they claim to be open but are not. </p>
						<p>While the open community doesn't have the capital of big business behind it, we are effective communicators and in command of social media. We can exercise the court of public opinion.</p>
						<p>That said, we should recognise that not everything can be openned right away. We each have to pick our battles as individuals, but the key thing is for us to acknowledge the ideal of open. We can treat closed like an annoying niggle, a pebble in our shoe, perhaps. We might put up with it for a while because we need to get somewhere, but we eventually get fed up and deal with it. Closed should never be accepted as the ethical equal of open.</p>

						<p>Now, I'd like to leave you with a thought that I often find comforting in this world where closed masquerades as open and often gets away with it. There's an institutional bastion of open from which our movement can learn much, and it's so woven into the fabrics of many communities that its signficance is often overlooked... </p>
