						<p>My task today is to define a word with looms large at this conference, making up fully half of the words in its title. Everybody has a sense of the world "Open" means, and that sense differs depending on who you talk to and depending on the context.</p>
						<p>Like many words, notably "natural", "organic" the word "open" has been lept upon by marketers who have identified that its meaning is so vague that it can be used to convey positive connotations about products which have not earned those connotations. They have succeeded in diluting the word "open" still further, to the extent that some of us have become a bit cynical and could rightly be described to be suffering from what market analysts refer to as "open fatigue" (I'm joking).</p>
						<p>So my goal here is to strip back the meaning of the word "open" in the contexts of  open source software and open society to its essence. And what is that, you might ask.</p>

						<p>Fundamentally, open in this context has to do with the human instinct to share.
						It's innate in most of us from a young age, but for many of us, like being inquisitive and having fun, the urge to share is something that we are taught to repress. In the professional - dare I say "enterprise" - world, talking about sharing was, for a long time, seen as quaint, hippy, naive, and even self-destructive. When I got into open source software, people in the "respectable" business world used to sneer and even openly laugh at those of us who promoted it. How times change.</p>
						<p>Part of the purpose of this conference is to help those of us who have become suspicious of those who share - and who recommend that others share for our mutual enrichment - recognise that we aren't joking. I suspect most of you're here today because you've been hearing a growing "buzz" around this concept of openness, typically associated with the rise of digital society and the Internet, and you want to understand its implications. I hope this conference shows you how much power you'll find in the principles of openness.</p>

					<h1>Freedom underlying Open Source Software</h1>

					<p class="fragment">Modify</p>
					<p class="fragment">Share</p>

					<aside class="notes">
						<p>Open Source Software was originally called Free Software, where the free refers to
						  freedom, not cost. More specifically, it safeguards the freedom of the <em>user</em>
							rather than the developer. That is a <em>very</em> deliberate and profound distinction.</p>
							<p>Free Software was a concept developed by a legendary programmer,
							<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Stallman">Richard Stallman</a>, known to most in the programming community by his initials "RMS".</p>
							<p>He was part of a programmer community distributed among the US universities in the 1980s
							prior to the commercial world really taking notice of software. Originally,
							business saw the value lying in hardware, which at the time was eye wateringly expensive.</p>
							<p>To make the hardware compelling, it had to run useful software, but the community
							of developers was so small, mostly tied to universities where the hardware and software
							were being developed, that they all knew each other and all shared their code
							much in the way scientists test their theories thought publication and peer review.
						</p>
						<p>Like him or not (many find him very abrasive), he's undeniably a visionary and genius. He understood the implications of the digital era when it was just dawning and took action, providing us all with tools to protect our freedom in the face of a carving up of the original digital "commons" by commercial interests - it was a virtual analogue to the land grabs of colonial powers in the previous few centuries. We're all only just catching up to him 30 years later.</p>
						<p>In my opinion, we in the open source community owe RMS a huge debt of gratitude. His
						invention of the GPL licence created the first - ground breaking and amazingly robust - legal framework for ensuring that open source can be enforced. </p>
						<p>The GPL makes very clever use of Copyright law to ensure that users of works licenced under its terms, and any derived works, cannot withold those rights from others. He called his legal invention a "copyleft." Many of the most widely used and best known open source projects, including the Linux kernel, are made available under the GPL licence.</p>
						<p>His commitment to his principles - he's the poster boy for walking the talk - has meant
							that he's been able to plant the flag so far into "open" territory, that the rest of us
							look moderate by comparison. Make no mistake, commercial interests hated RMS because he threatened their new software sales models - and the built-in monopolies that they were able to create and exploit for historically almost unprecedented profits - by keeping key bits of information about their software proprietary. Those companies, led by Microsoft, mounted many campaigns to smear Free Software's reputation in the marketplace and convince people that it was worthless.</p>
							<p>Then the Internet, built almost entirely on Free Software, came along, and everything changed. The Internet, in turn, gave software developers the tools they needed to rapidly share their work around the world, and they created a virtuous cycle, which ah</p>
						<p>The term, "Open Source" was actually coined by a group of technologists who wanted to address the unfortunate ambiguity of the word Free, with its multiple meanings in English. They decided to rebrand Free Software as Open Source to make it more palatable to commerical entities who didn't like the connotation of "free" - both in terms of cost, and freedom. The term Open Source took hold immediately, and over time, with the help of many companies who recognised the value of the Free Software development methodology, the original motivation of Free Software - to protect the user's freedoms to share - has largely been replaced by more expedient concerns.</p>
						<p>There's a new generation of programmers now, who have always lived in a world with open source software</p>

					<h1>Principles underlying Open Society</h1>
					<p class="fragment">Reason over tradition</p>
					<p class="fragment">Personal and political freedom over cultural hierarchy</p>
					<p class="fragment">Empowering the individual to question the status quo</p>
					<p class="fragment">Tolerate everything but intolerance</p>

					<aside class="notes">
						<p>I think that today, the Open in Open Society is in effect applying the principles of Open Source Software to society at large, especially our social institutions.</p>
						<p>Interestingly, the term Open Society has a major New Zealand connection. </p>
						<p>The concept of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_society">Open Society</a> was, fleshed out by one man: an Austrian philosopher, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Popper">Karl Popper</a>. He wrote his seminal book on the subject, The Open Society and its Enemies, while he was lecturing in philosophy at, of all places, the University of Canterbury, in Christchurch, New Zealand, in the late 1930s. </p>
						<p>I encourage you all to read more about his pretty comprehensive ideas on what an Open Society should entail and why he thought it was the only way forward for humanity. </p>

							<li>It allows for true accountability: people can see and question a decision
								because they can it is consistent with the see the factors on which it was based.</li>
